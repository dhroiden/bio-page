            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>I am an engineer at Amazon Web Services. I spend a lot of time thinking about AWSâ€™s Analytics and
                Database services, especially Amazon Redshift. Redshift is Amazon's fully managed, petabyte-scale data
                warehouse.</p>

            <p>Prior to Amazon, I was a software engineer at Cloudera working in the Impala SQL-on-Hadoop query engine.
                There I was working mostly on Impala's backend.</p>

            <p>Before joining Impala and Cloudera, I was a member of the research staff at IBM Almaden Research Center.
                My research focused on scalable data management on modern hardware platforms. I worked in IBM's DB2 BLU
                project, which is part of IBM's DB2 v10.5 with BLU Acceleration release. BLU is the column-store (in)
                DB2.</p>

            <p>Before joining IBM Almaden, I received my Ph.D. from the Electrical & Computer Engineering department at
                Carnegie Mellon University and my Diploma from the Computer Engineering and Informatics Department
                (CEID) of the University of Patras, Greece.</p>

            <p>I am the president of <a href="http://www.hpts.ws/" target="_blank">HPTS</a> the <q><i>Davos of
                        Databases</i></q>.</p>
